# Week 2 team social event

Team Anki

Kyla Lamontagne, Wilbur Chen, Dillon Gee, Vamsi Koduru, Jazmynn-Jade Daos

We went to Java City for our team's social event. Each of us ordered food or 
a drink and then went to a place to hangout. Our team chose to go to the tables 
near Java City. We went to a table to eat and talk about various things for an hour.
